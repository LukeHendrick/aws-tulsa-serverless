# AWS Tulsa Meetup - Serverless
 ### This repo is designed to walk you through the basic steps of creating a new AWS stack using the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/). The `master` branch is the completed project, start with [stepOne](https://github.com/LukeHendrick/aws-tulsa-serverless/tree/stepOne)
## Before You Begin
This project relies on the Serverless Framework, and as such requires a few packages be installed.

First, please make sure you have Node installed and npm is available for use on the command line. To check, run the following command from Terminal/cmd:

`npm --version`

If you do not see a version number printed (e.g. `6.4.1
`), please download and install Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Next, run the following command to install the Serverless Framework:

`npm i -g serverless`

Finally, you will need an AWS account to deploy services into, visit [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/free/start-your-free-trial) to get started.

If you have any questions, reach out on the #meetups channel in [Slack](https://awstulsa.slack.com/messages/CLWKXNDNF "https://awstulsa.slack.com/messages/CLWKXNDNF"), or open a new issue on this repo!

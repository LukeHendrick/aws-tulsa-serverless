# Step Two

Adding a function, we define the handler (the first method called when the lambda is invoked) and a simple API Gateway event that triggers on path /hello

An example API Gateway link:

`https://yt9srzume8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello`

Deploy with:

`serverless deploy`

Remove with:

`serverless remove`
